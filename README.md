My name is Edmund. Year 1 in Electronic Engineering.

I created my pathing algorithm using A* algorithm, 
ther reason for choosing A* are as follow:

1) A* outputs the shortest path from the start node to the target node 
2) A* never over estimates the true cost
3) A* uses both actual cost from the starting node and estimated cost to the goal, balancing exploration of new paths with efficient progression toward the goal.
4) A* are more suitable for applying to real world problem such as deliveries.

This project was assisted by Website such as stackoverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19193413/pathfinding-in-a-grid-system)
and AI for generating the base code.
The website help me in understanding the algorithm and figuring out the equations in the algorithm, i used about 2 days to get a foot hold in A*.
then I took 3 days to generate and write the code, with sometime used in debuging.
